# Harness adapter guide

Coven should treat every harness as an adapter. The daemon ships a small bundled compatibility adapter set for Codex, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot CLI, but no harness should become privileged runtime logic. OpenClaw, Hermes, Aider, Gemini, and future agents should enter through the same adapter contract and maturity checklist.

The goal is a harness-neutral runtime:

- Coven owns project-root validation, PTY supervision, session ids, event replay, and local socket policy.
- The adapter owns how to detect and invoke one external CLI.
- Provider auth, model/provider config, tools, skills, and memory stay inside that external harness.
- Clients can discover supported adapters with `coven adapter list` instead of hard-coding "Codex vs Claude" assumptions.

## Current adapter shape

A Coven harness adapter defines:

- stable Coven harness id;
- user-facing label;
- executable name to detect on `PATH`;
- prompt argument shape for interactive mode;
- prompt argument shape for non-interactive mode;
- install/authentication hint for `coven doctor`; and
- optional **declared behavior**: `capabilities`, `sandbox`, `stream_args`,
  `continuity_args`, and a finite `event_protocol` (see below).

The current implementation expects the prompt to be the final command argument after any fixed prefix args — either as a positional behind `--`, or bound to a declared `prompt_flag` (`--flag=<prompt>`) for harnesses with no positional prompt slot. Keep that invariant unless the adapter explicitly documents a safer stdin or protocol mode.

## External adapter rule

New harnesses should not be added as one-off special cases across the daemon, TUI, docs, OpenClaw plugin, and package READMEs. Add a reusable adapter description first, then wire the daemon and clients against that description.

For now, Codex, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot CLI remain the bundled compatibility defaults. Additional harnesses can be tested through explicit adapter manifests.

Load one manifest file:

```json
{
  "adapters": [
    {
      "id": "example",
      "label": "Example Harness",
      "executable": "example",
      "interactive_prompt_prefix_args": [],
      "non_interactive_prompt_prefix_args": ["run", "--quiet"],
      "install_hint": "Install Example Harness and make sure `example` is on PATH.",
      "system_prompt_flag": null
    }
  ]
}
```

```sh
export COVEN_HARNESS_ADAPTER_MANIFEST=/path/to/adapters.json
coven adapter list
coven adapter doctor example
```

Load every `*.json` manifest in one or more directories:

```sh
export COVEN_HARNESS_ADAPTER_DIRS="$HOME/.coven/adapters:$HOME/.config/coven/adapters"
coven adapter list --json
```

Coven does not auto-discover adapter manifests from `COVEN_HOME`, `~/.coven`, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. External manifests are trusted code-launch configuration, so operators must opt in with `COVEN_HARNESS_ADAPTER_MANIFEST` or `COVEN_HARNESS_ADAPTER_DIRS`.

The prompt is appended as the final command argument after the configured prefix args (bound to the declared `prompt_flag` when the adapter has one). Adapter ids must be lowercase and must not collide with built-in ids. Executables are names only, not shell strings or paths.

### Declared capabilities, sandbox, and stream args

A manifest adapter can additionally declare what it *can do*, using the same
fields as the [coven-runtimes](https://github.com/OpenCoven/coven-runtimes)
manifest spec (the manifest shape is a backward-compatible superset — legacy
adapters deserialize unchanged with everything off):

```json
{
  "adapters": [
    {
      "id": "example",
      "label": "Example Harness",
      "executable": "example",
      "interactive_prompt_prefix_args": [],
      "non_interactive_prompt_prefix_args": ["--print"],
      "install_hint": "Install Example Harness and make sure `example` is on PATH.",
      "capabilities": { "stream": true, "preassigned_session_id": true },
      "sandbox": { "flag": "--permission-mode", "full": "bypass-permissions", "read_only": "plan" },
      "stream_args": {
        "prefix_args": ["--print", "--input-format", "stream-json", "--output-format", "stream-json"],
        "session_id_flag": "--session-id",
        "resume_flag": "--resume"
      },
      "continuity_args": {
        "init_prefix_args": ["--print"],
        "resume_prefix_args": ["--print"],
        "session_id_flag": "--session-id",
        "resume_flag": "--resume"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `capabilities.stream` + `stream_args` let the daemon drive the adapter in
  long-lived stream-json mode, exactly like the bundled Claude adapter (which
  declares the same fields internally). `stream` requires `stream_args`;
  `stream_args` without `stream` is rejected as dead config.
- `capabilities.preassigned_session_id` requires a session id flag in either
  `stream_args` or `continuity_args`.
- `continuity_args` tells one-shot non-interactive runs how to initialize or
  resume an upstream conversation. `session_id_flag` is only valid when
  `capabilities.preassigned_session_id` is true; resume-only adapters can omit
  it and use `resume_prefix_args` to place the resumed session id as a
  positional argument.
- `event_protocol` (alias `eventProtocol`) selects a reviewed machine-readable
  stdout translator for a **finite** headless process. The first supported
  value is `grok-headless-v1`, matching Grok Build's public
  `--output-format streaming-json` emitter. An event protocol and
  `capabilities.stream` are mutually exclusive: the former exits after one
  prompt, while the latter is a long-lived bidirectional process.
- `sandbox` maps `coven run --permission <full|read-only>` to the harness's
  native flags. Two forms: a single `--flag value` pair per policy (shown
  above), or an argv list per policy for boolean/multi-token permission flags:
  `{ "full_args": ["--allow-all"], "read_only_args": ["--deny-tool", "write"] }`.
- `coven adapter list --json` includes the declared `capabilities` block for
  every bundled or manifest adapter, using the same field names as manifests.
- `add_dir_flag` (alias `addDirFlag`) names the harness's native flag for
  trusting an additional directory beyond its cwd. Each
  `coven run --add-dir <DIR>` repeats as `[flag, <dir>]` ahead of the prompt
  (the bundled Codex, Claude, engine, and Copilot adapters all declare
  `--add-dir`).
- `prompt_flag` (alias `promptFlag`) names a flag that carries the user
  prompt as its **value** for harnesses with no positional prompt slot (e.g.
  Copilot's `--prompt`, Hermes' `-q`). Coven appends the bound
  `--flag=<prompt>` form instead of `-- <prompt>`, so `-`-prefixed prompts
  stay data. `interactive_prompt_flag` (alias `interactivePromptFlag`)
  optionally overrides it for interactive launches only (Copilot opens its
  TUI with `--interactive=<prompt>` but exits after a `--prompt=<prompt>`
  run). Omit both and the prompt stays the final positional argument behind
  `--`.
- Adapters that declare none of this keep today's conservative behavior:
  one-shot launches only, `--permission` and `--add-dir` are warned no-ops.

Accepted, conformance-tested manifests for real runtimes live in the
[coven-runtimes canonical registry](https://github.com/OpenCoven/coven-runtimes).

This manifest path is for explicit integration work. It is not a public support claim for every adapter listed in a maintainer's local manifest.

### Trusted installable recipes

Coven can ship reviewed external manifests without promoting them into the bundled compatibility set. Users install these versioned recipes explicitly; Coven then loads them from its trusted adapter directory only while their contents exactly match the bundled recipe.

```sh
coven adapter install grok
coven adapter doctor grok
coven run grok "what is in this project?"
```

The Grok Build recipe uses the documented `grok --single` headless interface, model and session flags, native permission/sandbox controls, and the source-defined `streaming-json` event schema. Coven translates native text/end/error frames, suppresses thought frames, and verifies the returned session id. See [Grok Build (experimental)](/harnesses/grok-build) for the exact contract and remaining promotion checks.

## Model selection (`coven run --model`)

`coven run --model <ID>` selects the model a harness runs on and forwards it to the harness's native flag. Clients such as Cave drive harnesses through `coven run … -- <prompt>` and pass `--model` ahead of the `--` separator (it is a normal option, so it always parses before the variadic prompt positional).

Two decisions clients must match:

- **Provider-prefix handling — Coven strips it.** Cave stores and sends a namespaced id (e.g. `openai/gpt-5.5`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`). Coven strips the leading `provider/` segment and forwards the **bare** id to the harness (`codex --model gpt-5.5`, `claude --model claude-sonnet-4`), because the native CLIs expect bare model ids. A bare id with no slash is forwarded unchanged. Only the first `/` segment is treated as the provider namespace.
- **`system.init` echo field — `model`.** When `--stream-json` is set, the `system.init` event carries a `model` field with the id **exactly as requested** on `--model` (namespaced form preserved), or `null` when no `--model` was passed. Echoing the requested id verbatim lets a client confirm acceptance (`applied` vs `pending`) with an exact match against its stored selection, independent of Coven's internal prefix-stripping.

Built-in Codex and Claude adapters both declare `--model`. External adapters declare how they take a model in the manifest:

- `model_flag` (alias `modelFlag`): a simple `--flag <value>` pair. Coven forwards `[flag, <bare-model>]`.
- `model_arg_template` (alias `modelArgTemplate`): for anything else (e.g. Codex's config-override form `-c model=<value>`). The template is split on whitespace into argv tokens and every `{model}` placeholder is substituted with the bare model id — no shell quoting, so write `"-c model={model}"`, not `'-c model="{model}"'`. Takes precedence over `model_flag` when both are set.

An adapter that declares **neither** field makes `--model` a **warned no-op** for that adapter: Coven prints a warning to stderr and continues the run rather than failing.

```json
{
  "adapters": [
    {
      "id": "example",
      "label": "Example Harness",
      "executable": "example",
      "interactive_prompt_prefix_args": [],
      "non_interactive_prompt_prefix_args": ["run", "--quiet"],
      "install_hint": "Install Example Harness and make sure `example` is on PATH.",
      "model_flag": "--model"
    }
  ]
}
```

A code-backed adapter should still be shaped as data plus narrow translation functions. The adapter registry/manifest can describe:

- `id`, `label`, and `executable`;
- detection and setup hints;
- interactive, one-shot, and optional stream/resume argv;
- whether the adapter supports preassigned upstream session ids;
- whether the adapter has a dedicated system-prompt/identity flag;
- output expectations and known unsupported modes; and
- client compatibility notes for OpenClaw, CastCodes, and other consumers.

Do not promote a harness to public support by only adding it to `built_in_harness_specs()`. That makes the UI and docs look supported before the adapter contract is proven.

## Bundled compatibility adapters

The bundled compatibility adapters are Codex, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot CLI. They are first-class supported user paths, not a model for hardcoding every future harness.

### Codex

- Harness id: `codex`
- Executable: `codex`
- Interactive prefix args: none
- Non-interactive prefix args: `exec --skip-git-repo-check --color never`
- Model flag: `--model` (the equivalent `-c model=<value>` override is available to external adapters via `model_arg_template`)

Setup hint:

```sh
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex login
```

### Claude Code

- Harness id: `claude`
- Executable: `claude`
- Interactive prefix args: none
- Non-interactive prefix args: `--print`
- Model flag: `--model`

Setup hint:

```sh
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude doctor
```

## First external integration: OpenClaw

OpenClaw is the first external integration boundary for Coven, but it is not a daemon-launched harness id. The external OpenClaw bridge plugin is an external OpenClaw ACP runtime bridge:

- OpenClaw registers ACP backend id `coven`.
- The bridge talks to the local Coven daemon over the configured Unix socket.
- OpenClaw chooses an ACP agent id, maps it to a Coven harness id, and launches a project-scoped Coven session.
- Coven validates the project root, harness id, session id, input, and kill requests.
- OpenClaw keeps responsibility for its own UI, chat/session routing, plugin lifecycle, and ACP bindings.

This is the integration shape future clients should follow: consume Coven's socket API and adapter discovery, do not import daemon internals or require Coven to know OpenClaw internals.

## Adapter requirements

Before adding a new harness, confirm:

- the CLI can be detected safely on `PATH`;
- the prompt can be passed without shell interpolation;
- the process can run from a validated project cwd;
- output can be captured through a PTY or a reviewed machine-readable pipe
  protocol and replayed as Coven session events;
- authentication stays in the harness provider's normal local flow;
- failure modes are understandable in `coven doctor`;
- tests cover command construction and missing executable behavior.

## Adapter commands

Use these commands to debug a machine that only has Codex, Claude Code, or a local manifest adapter installed:

```sh
coven adapter list
coven adapter list --json
coven adapter doctor
coven adapter doctor codex
coven adapter doctor claude
```

`coven doctor` includes the same configured adapter set in its broader local runtime report.

## Adding a new adapter

1. Start with a research note in `docs/FUTURE-HARNESSES.md` or a dedicated `docs/harnesses/<id>.md` page.
2. Document the exact CLI contract: install, auth/setup, interactive launch, one-shot prompt launch, quiet/programmatic output mode, resume/session behavior, and unsupported modes.
3. Add command-construction tests before changing user-facing docs to say the harness is supported.
4. Add `coven adapter doctor` / `coven doctor` detection and setup hints.
5. Add launch behavior behind the generic adapter path, not scattered string checks.
6. Add client compatibility notes for the OpenClaw bridge and any CastCodes surfaces that expose the harness.
7. Run a smoke test against a real install or clearly document that support is still research-only.

## What not to add yet

Avoid generic arbitrary command adapters until Coven has explicit policy and approval behavior for them.

Arbitrary commands are more dangerous than named harness adapters because they can blur the difference between "run a coding agent in this project" and "execute whatever string a client sent." Keep v0 narrow.

## Future harness evaluation checklist

For a candidate harness, document:

- install command;
- executable name;
- local auth flow;
- one-shot prompt command;
- interactive command;
- resume/session command, if any;
- non-interactive output mode;
- whether stdin prompt injection is needed;
- whether the CLI can disable color/control sequences;
- whether the CLI can avoid shell quoting hazards;
- known exit codes;
- minimum safe smoke test.

## Session identity mapping

Some harnesses have their own upstream session ids. Coven's session id remains the local runtime id. A harness that safely accepts a caller-assigned UUID may use the same value upstream, but Coven still verifies the native terminal metadata before trusting that mapping.

If upstream ids become useful, store them as metadata rather than replacing Coven's own id. Clients should be able to rely on a stable Coven id for attach, events, archive, summon, and sacrifice.

## Suggested adapter maturity stages

1. **Research note** - document CLI shape and risks.
2. **Command construction tests** - prove argv construction is safe.
3. **Doctor detection** - add install/auth hints.
4. **Launch smoke** - prove a session can run in a temporary project.
5. **Attach/replay smoke** - prove events can be replayed.
6. **Client compatibility** - update CastCodes-facing docs and advanced-client integration tests.

Do not skip from research directly to public support.

A harness skipping any stage is **not** ready for public support, even if it appears to work on a maintainer's machine.
