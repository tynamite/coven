---

Coven does **not** bundle harness CLIs. Each supported harness is an independent CLI that Coven detects on `PATH` at launch time and supervises through a PTY adapter. This page shows the install commands for every v0 harness and explains how `coven doctor` reports detection results.

## How detection works

`coven doctor`, `coven adapter doctor`, and `POST /api/v1/sessions` all resolve a harness id (`codex`, `claude`, …) to an executable name on `PATH` using the adapter registry in [Harness adapters](/HARNESS-ADAPTERS). If the binary is missing, Coven fails closed with an install hint instead of attempting to launch.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Run["coven run codex prompt"] --> Daemon[Coven daemon]
  Daemon --> Lookup{harness id known?}
  Lookup -- no --> Reject1[Reject: unsupported harness]
  Lookup -- yes --> Resolve{executable on PATH?}
  Resolve -- no --> Hint["Reject: install hint via coven doctor"]
  Resolve -- yes --> Spawn[Spawn validated argv in PTY]
```

The daemon revalidates the harness id on every launch request. Clients cannot widen the allowlist by sending a different argv or path; only bundled compatibility adapters and explicit manifest adapters are accepted.

## Supported v0 harnesses

| Harness id | Executable | Install command | Provider login | Detail page |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `codex` | `codex` | `npm install -g @openai/codex` | `codex login` | [Codex harness](/harnesses/codex) |
| `claude` | `claude` | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` | `claude doctor` | [Claude Code harness](/harnesses/claude-code) |
| `copilot` | `copilot` | `npm install -g @github/copilot` | `copilot login` | [Copilot CLI harness](/harnesses/copilot-cli) |

Other CLIs (Hermes, Aider, Gemini CLI, Cline, custom commands) are **not** bundled in v0. Test them through an explicit manifest and `coven adapter doctor`; see [Future harness notes](/FUTURE-HARNESSES) for the adapter direction.

Grok Build has a reviewed **experimental recipe** but is not bundled by default. Install the Grok CLI and authenticate first, then run `coven adapter install grok`; see [Grok Build](/harnesses/grok-build) for the complete setup and permission mapping.

## Step-by-step install

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install at least one harness">
    Pick the harness you want to drive first. You can install more later.

    ```bash
    # OpenAI Codex
    npm install -g @openai/codex

    # Anthropic Claude Code
    npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

    # GitHub Copilot CLI
    npm install -g @github/copilot
    ```

    Other install paths (Homebrew, package managers, build-from-source) are documented in each project's own README. Coven only requires the binary to be on `PATH` under the expected executable name.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Finish provider auth in the harness CLI">
    Coven never touches provider credentials. Run each CLI's own login flow once.

    ```bash
    codex login
    claude doctor
    copilot login
    ```

    See [Provider auth boundary](/harnesses/provider-auth) for the rationale.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Coven sees the harness">
    ```bash
    coven doctor
    coven adapter list
    ```

    Expected output (abridged):

    ```text
    store:    ok
    project:  ok  (/path/to/project)
    daemon:   running  (pid 12345)
    codex:    ok       (/usr/local/bin/codex 0.x.y)
    claude:   ok       (/usr/local/bin/claude 0.x.y)
    copilot:  ok       (/usr/local/bin/copilot 1.x.y)
    ```

    If a row shows `missing`, doctor also prints the exact install command shown in the table above. `coven adapter list --json` is the machine-readable form for clients such as Coven Cave.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch a session">
    ```bash
    coven run codex "describe this repo"
    coven run claude "polish the CLI help text"
    coven run copilot "explain the failing CI job"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Updating a harness

Coven does not auto-update harness CLIs. Treat them as ordinary global npm (or other package-manager) installs:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex@latest
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest
npm install -g @github/copilot@latest
```

After updating, re-run `coven doctor` to confirm the resolved path/version still matches what you expect.

## Custom executable locations

If a harness is installed under a non-`PATH` directory (for example, a project-local `node_modules/.bin`), make sure that directory is on `PATH` **before** the daemon starts. Coven respects the daemon process environment, not the calling shell environment, when launching PTYs.

If you change `PATH` system-wide, restart the daemon:

```bash
coven daemon restart
coven doctor
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `coven doctor` reports a harness as `missing` even after install | New shell `PATH` not picked up by the daemon | `coven daemon restart`, then `coven doctor`. |
| Doctor finds the binary but `coven run` fails immediately | Provider auth incomplete | Re-run `codex login` / `claude doctor` / `copilot login`. See [provider auth](/harnesses/provider-auth). |
| Doctor shows a stale version | Older binary earlier on `PATH` | `which -a codex` (or `claude`, `copilot`) and remove the duplicate. |
| Doctor reports `unsupported harness` | Typo in harness id | Use one of the ids in the table above. |
